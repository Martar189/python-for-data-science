# Heads and tails

Simulate infinite coin flips repeatedly and compute the mean number of flips required until the number of heads equals the number of tails.

For example:

| **Sequence** | **Flips** |
|--------------|-----------|
| HT           | 2         |
| HHTT         | 4         |
| HHTHTT       | 6         |
| TTHTHH       | 6         |
| TTTHHH       | 6         |
| *Mean*       | 4.8       |

How does the probability of landing on heads affect your estimates?
