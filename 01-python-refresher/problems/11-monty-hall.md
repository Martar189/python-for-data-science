# Monty Hall game

Simulate multiple rounds of the Monty Hall game described below. In particular, show the effect of always keeping the first guess compared to always switching.

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
> You pick a door — say the first — and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door — say the third — which has a goat.
> He says to you: do you want to pick the second door? Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?

**Hint**: we can always relabel the doors so that our choice is always the 'first door'. The host then opens the 'second door' unless it has the prize, in which case the host opens the 'third door'.
