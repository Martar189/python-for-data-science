# Roll duplicates

Simulate the roll of a given number of fair six-sided dice repeatedly and compute the proportion of times when at least two dice showed the same number.

For example (assuming 5 dice):

| **Dice**     | **Duplicates** |
|--------------|----------------|
| 11666        | Yes            |
| 13456        | No             |
| 14455        | Yes            |
| 23356        | Yes            |
| 24566        | Yes            |
| *Proportion* | 0.8            |

How does the number of dice affect your estimates?
