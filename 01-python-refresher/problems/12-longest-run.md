# Longest run of heads

Simulate a given number of coin flips repeatedly and compute the mean length of the longest run of heads across simulations.

For example (assuming 5 coin flips):

| **Sequence** | **Longest run** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| HTTHH        | 2               |
| THTHT        | 1               |
| THTTH        | 1               |
| TTHHT        | 2               |
| TTHTT        | 1               |
| *Mean*       | 1.4             |

How does the probability of landing on heads affect your estimates?
